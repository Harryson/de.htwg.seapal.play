## Seapal Setup

1. clone ```https://github.com/pakohan/de.htwg.seapal.core```
2. change to cloned folder
3. run ```sbt compile && sbt package```; this will create the class files and put em together in a nice jar file
4. take the jar from ```target/core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar``` and put it into the ```lib``` directory of the seapal Project, no you have a freshly compiled core
